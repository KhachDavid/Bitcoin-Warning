It is required to have all the CSS, JS, and Image files in a folder called Static. 

There also has to be a folder called templates where you should place the file index.html

The set-up should look like this!

project---
  templates---
    ---index.html
  static---
    ---js
    ---css
    ---img
   application.py 
   
Before running the code make sure to install the flask and requests libraries!
